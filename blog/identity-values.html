            <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
              <p>There was a point in my time working at a pharmacy where I was faced with the choice of giving a patient a new medicine which was being rationed at the moment, or save it up for other patients who were on repeats who will be coming in to take this particular medicine in the next few days as their repeat was due. My values of giving help to those who needed it in the moment still came through, and even though it would have been difficult to explain to the patient who was on repeats that we were out of stock because the government is rationing supplies, it was the best in the moment for that patient to recieve their antibiotics and start on it immediately. In retrospect I could have asked them to try a different pharmacy to get their medicines, something like antibiotics is not something that you can put off taking for long and I think I still made the right decision in that particular moment.</p>
            <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
              <p>In terms of the culture that I lived around, I grew up in a very asian household and my parents constantly upheld values such as working hard to get what I wanted, and in school it was definitely always very competitive to be the top student as it meant feeling the prestige and admiration of your friends and classmates. However, after coming to New Zealand I also learnt a lot more about being kind and giving support to those less fortunate to you as well, and hence a value that I hold to high regard is the idea of mututal respect and going out of your way to help people when they happen to need it. Even if it does take time, I like to imagine that the other person will get a lot more out of my help than what I would've got out of the time I spent helping them instead.</p>
            <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
              <p>When I do get around to starting on projects, I find myself being motivated to finish them usually. Even though getting started on them might be a bit of a challenge, when I get focused I tend to get a lot of things done. I also find myself having a lot of different ways to tackle an issue, so I don't tend to have problems when it comes to knowing what to do next. </p>
            <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
              <p>I think in terms of weaknesses, I tend to focus a lot on failure and having a hard time moving past those. Sometimes I focus too much on the idea of having done something not to a good enough standard instead of reflecting and working on what I could do better next time, in a more objective way rather than reacting emotionally to it. By doing that it could potentially impair time spent on a project that I may lag behind in terms of work that needs to be done. I also definitely struggle with voicing when I encounter problems or need help as well so I don't look weak.</p>
            <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
              <p>There was once where at a workplace two staff members got into an argument with each other while work was piling up on our end. I ended up working harder with one other staff who was still there in order to keep the workplace going, so that was all I did in terms of strategy, to get the most out of the staff who was actually there. In the future I want to attempt to resolve the situation or at least intervene so work gets done, rather than having only two people or less work through everything that needs to be done. </p>
