        <h2 class="blog-heading">Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
              I want to be able to use the skills I've learnt from to find what I'm the most interested in doing, and hopefully getting an internship or position that I will enjoy, and perhaps even furthering
              my own studies and education on these to make my portfolio and CV more appealing to those who might be interested in hiring me.
            </p>
          <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p>
              Something I think I'll struggle on would probably be working on projects or tasks in my own time at home, but hopefully I will be able to concentrate and work hard enough in bootcamp that I will be 
              able to minimize and give myself some time to unwind and relax away from studies and tasks as well.
            </p>
          <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
            <p>
              I think that would probably be keeping focused for 9 weeks straight to finish tasks that I have been given, and not being worn out, hopefully
            </p>
          <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>
              Probably just being a better listener, so I can give more thoughtful and meaningful responses to people and also better reflection on the things I've done so I can learn better from them. And also
              leadership skills for sure, to be able to lead groups and delegate tasks if possible to someone's strength.
            </p>
          <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
            <p>
              That I will be able to find help when I need it, or resolve issues with other students in an understanding and amicable form.
            </p>
          <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
              That I will be receptive of all learning, and work to my fullest while on campus to give the most to myself and learn as much as I can to truly bring this career change into a possibility for me.
            </p>
        <h2 class="blog-heading">Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
          <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>In the long term, I want to be in a career or job where I have the flexibility to work from whenever, not being stuck to a rigid 9 to 5 schedule but rather objective based workplace and set my own goals to achieve and work towards. Considering that this would be a change in career for me to my previous path; doing anything that doesn't involve dealing with customers in person and having to argue on menial things like pricing or dragged all over the place and getting nothing done in the end would be a good goal for me.</p>
          <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
            <p>I feel like with learning, when I do get in the headspace to be receptive to new content I tend to take it in very well, especially so if I get some hands on experience with working with the content. Another strength would be being able to take note on what I struggle with in terms of learning and go back on it in a few days to check if I've understood or otherwise I'll get help. Which brings me to my limitations in my learning; I still feel that urge to solve everything myself and sometimes find myself stumped on a issue or problem for a long period of time. I also find myself struggling to study sometimes when it comes to self learning, however I definitely still try to work towards knowing all the things I need to by comparing to the learning competencies, and any extras if I can.</p>
          <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>A skill that I would definitely like to develop more is being able to describe technical details or jargon in a more simplified format to those who might not understand it as it is an extremely important skill especially when working with clients or coworkers in different fields; I find it can definitely help myself to understand an issue even more as well (rubber ducky method) and get other people's opinions on it in a more overarching view rather than technical. And of course, being able to ask for help when I need it is a skill that I definitely need to develop more too.</p>
          <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
            <p>I will be open to communication and respond in a timely manner to people who request information from me, and stick to the timer for myself to work and take breaks when needed so I can maximise my productivity as well. I will aim to commit and push work as often as possible to commit myself to working on schedule and for accountability. When things start building up I will definitely seek advice from facilitators and help from those who are able to support me before it becomes too late.</p>
          <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            <p>I do expect facilitators to help with the best that they can as well when I run into issues, and to sort out any confusing or misleading information in the course before it can spread further.</p>
          <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
            <p>I will strive to be available 9-5, however out of those times it should be reasonable that I might not be able to get to any messages sent to me.</p>
