        <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the idea that the brain is malleable, and intelligence and experience can be gathered from repeated practice and forming new connections in the brain as such. 
            It especially helps in the first place to understand that the idea of learning new things is very much possible even for older people, and that putting information into context 
            with our lives can change the mindset and help growth.
          </p>

        <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
          <p>
            I think personally I need to change my mindset on learning, that I can do all things in time but it just takes practice and hard work. Even though I'm a complete beginner 
            when it comes to developing, I will need to constantly tell myself that I will get there in the end and learn new skills to help me on that path.
          </p>

        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm thinking that during mindfulness training, that I will also engage with positive reinforcement and think about the future where I will be happier and more successful 
            with enough practice and training, and also through learning and exploring as much as I can to put certain concepts that I might be struggling with into context.

        <h3>Research Growth Mindset

        Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
          <p>
            Growth mindset is the idea that you should be open to learning, and that growth is not something that stagnates but can improve and change over time. I had a lack of confidence 
            in general when it comes to learning new things as I tend to feel like if I got something I could tend to catch on pretty quickly, so I do need to change my mindset in that growth can be gradual as well and putting something into practice is the best way to learn.
          </p>

        <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
          <p>
            I will definitely try to pace myself more, and learn to ask specific questions or for help in general when I need it, as being able to learn where exactly I've gone wrong helps 
            a lot more than floundering about and not knowing where to even start looking for help.

        <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
            <p>
              Along with what I've already planned with my learning strategy, I do intend to keep an open mind on learning and stop comparing myself to others, and realize that I am on my 
              own journey and path and I should focus on where I want to end up in the long run than for short term approval or clout.
