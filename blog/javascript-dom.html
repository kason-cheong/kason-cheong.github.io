      <h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
        <p>There used to be a quaint little store which sold trinkets and oddities,and it was run by a couple. Mr. Haychtee Emmel 
          (or HTML as he liked his friends to call him) was the one who would take care of the stock and important operations of 
          the store at the back, whereas Mrs. Sease See (or CSS for short) was the one who would make sure that the store was nice
          and clean and the stock was displayed in an appealing way. Although their store ran nicely for a while, Ms. CSS was tired
          of constantly having to rearrange the store when promotions was on and had to constantly rely on Mr. HTML for the latest 
          prices and stock. Eventually they started looking for solutions and stumbled on this quaint little robot, who was simply
          called "JS". They set it up and eventually realized that it was a hit with all the customers! The little JS went around 
          and gave all the customers personalized information and promotions and even used augmented reality to change a store up
          just for a customer, but in reality the store was exactly the same! The customers got what they wanted in feedback
          based on their input through JS, and Mrs CSS and Mr HTML didn't have to constantly change the layout of the store!

      <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h3>
        <p>Control flow is the way that a script is run by a computer, from the first to the last line of code, which also depends on 
          whether there are loops or conditionals that change it up as well. For example, it can be much like putting through a pharmacy script where
          the prescription is checked for clinical validity, then dispensed, then checked again by a pharmacist to make sure that everything is accurate.
          Loops would be like if something on the prescription was wrong, then the doctor would be called, and the script would be on hold until they got back
          to us or otherwise we could call them again or keep calling until they responded, then we would be able to finish off the prescription.

      <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
        <p>The DOM is the way to have a structured interface for things like HTML and CSS into objects and properties so that things like JavaScript is able to 
          interact with it and change it up. The DOM can be accessed by any programming language as well, not just JS. For example, Javascript can be used to
          interact with the DOM by changing the color of a particular heading or paragraph without altering the actual HTML itself.
        </p>
      <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>With arrays, data is arranged much like a list and datapoints are called elements. Accessing data can be done by 
          using "array[x]" where x is the index number of the element you want to access. Whereas with objects, data is accessed by 
          using "objectName.propertyName" to obtain the value of the particular property in the object.</p>
      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
        <p>Functions are a useful tool in JavaScript to make things happen on a webpage, such as moving certain elements around when buttons
          are clicked by the user or changing certain style elements up, all without changing the actual .html file or refreshing the page. </p>
