            <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                That I definitely need to work on tempering my own expectations about myself, and take steps slowly rather than 
                feeling inadequate comparing myself to others. And that I find I do feel better about learning new things when 
                I tell myself that I am still a beginner and that there is a lot to be done in terms of learning and that this is
                just scraping the surface. And also that I do need to work on being able to ask for help when I need it as well, 
                rather than feeling like I can just do it myself and just wasting time floundering about where I could be learning 
                instead.
              </p>
            <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
              <p>
                Values are important when it comes to learning, as people have their own ways of doing things and taking in new 
                information. And as such, in programming as well it is important to be mindful of how you do things so you can 
                set your own boundaries while also respecting those of others too. In the same vein, empathy is extremely important
                as people might struggle in areas that you don't and practising empathy to help and give advice is the best way of 
                working on that ourselves, and also maybe learn something new in the meantime too. And with self-awareness, being 
                able to recognize where you are struggling instead of fooling yourself makes it a lot more easier to take in new 
                information and learn rather than being stuck on what you think is the right way.
              </p>
            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                That would most likely be that human skills are just as important as programming skills, and being able to manage 
                yourself in that regard will work wonders when it comes to managing yourself and other people.
              </p>
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                I think it would be to do a reflection about myself honestly. Most of the time I think I do first then think later,
                so I don't feel like I'm learning as much as I should with these things or learning from places where I can be 
                improving.
              </p>
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
              <p>
                Because human and personal skills are important in an industry where you will be working as a team and convey your thoughts with others to get projects done. 
              </p>
            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
              <p>Sometimes I do feel like more time can be spent on programming, but having the right mindset does complement learning better and as such I can definitely say it's not time wasted.</p>
