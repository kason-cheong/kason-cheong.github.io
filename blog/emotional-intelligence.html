          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>Is the ability to control yourself, to improve compassion and the ability to make wise decisions, to understand ourselves and not let our emotions but our rational mind take hold in critical situations, and not acting on our impulses but understanding why we might feel a certain way about something and reflecting upon it.</p>
            
          <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
            <p> IQ is the measure of how effective someone may be at problem solving or thinking out of the box in a practical sense, and EQ is the measure of how well someone may control themselves to find a solution not guided by emotions or impulses.</p>
            
          <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
            <p>In leadership positions when you have to deal with collegaues and people, it is extremely important to guide decisions based on what's happening in the moment rather than underlying emotions or bias from a subconsious, and to being in the moment and listening and taking in, and also constantly journalling so you disclose things to yourself that you might have otherwise suppressed so you're able to process it in a different angle looking at it again.</p>

            <p>In short, I strongly believe that emotional intellengence will contribute to keeping more negative emotions in check as well, and living in the present will contribute the most to having a more bright future as well as you'll only be worrying about the only time that matters: now. </p>
