      <h3>That time I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <p>
          When I was working through one of the javascript excercises, I was having issue bringing up the key or name of one of the properties in a javascript object. I didn't know
          why exactly I was having an issue because I thought I knew what the notation was for recalling it. I looked around discord and online for exactly how to diagnose the issue,
          and I was feeling extremely frustrated throughout the whole ordeal. In the end I decided to break it down and look at each part of the function I was writing and what exactly
          each one did. Eventually I realized that I was using square brackets instead of a dot notation to call the key, and I had forgot to put quote marks in the square brackets; so
          essentially the function was trying to access a variable (that didn't exist) instead of the key in the object! It was much like trying to call your dog Fido over before realizing
          that he was actually named Rex all along! I felt rather foolish for spending as much time as I did on it but I did learn that sometimes simple things like double checking what 
          values are being recalled exactly and which objects and properties are being accessed can easily solve a seemingly hard issue. 
        </p>
      <h3>That time I elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
        <p>
          When I was working through the stretch goal katas for the javascript excercises, I already had some knowledge and know-how from how I problem solved the previous excercises so 
          I didn't have much issue with them and actually solved them quite elegantly. Of course, I also had hints from the questions themselves in terms of what functions I could use, but 
          I was still pleasantly surprised at how little effort I had in solving them even when from a first glance they did seem rather challenging. I used my regular problem solving techniques
          such as checking the discord, looking at previous questions that people had asked and double checking documentation online to make sure that all my notations were correct. I did feel
          relieved that I didn't have much issues on the problems, but I did also tell myself that I would have to keep doing this over to make sure that I could commit all this to memory and 
          I learned how there was various different ways to solve an issue depending on how you looked at it.
        </p>
      <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem solving techniques/processes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pseudocode: I do try to do a mental map of how I want the program to run, but I should try to write them down as comments instead of doing it in my head next time.</li>
          <li>Trying something: This is what I normally do, just to see what sort of outputs I get with various functios.</li>
          <li>Rubber ducky method: I do the same thing by talking to myself and going through my code, though I should try to make it as if I'm talking to someone else instead.</li>
          <li>Reading error messages: I should definitely get better at this, as error messages in npm do tend to be quite concise and makes it easier to pinpoint an issue.</li>
          <li>Console.logging: I've been doing more of this on this week's katas, so I know exactly where my function isn't working or what *is* working.</li>
          <li>Googling: My go to for documentation on various builtin methods or js issues. I try to look at various sites so I can wrap my head around different examples.</li>
          <li>Asking your peers for help: I should definitely also ask my classmates more as well, as some of them have some programming background that I can poke as well.</li>
          <li>Asking coaches for help: I should do this more often to further cement my understanding of certain builtin methods or more elegant/better ways to tackle issues.</li>
          <li>Improving your process with reflection: I need to do this after I actually get functions or code working, so I know exactly where I got stuck on so I won't repeat the same mistakes next time and waste precious time.</li>
        </ul>
